# Project Make Effective Data Visualisation

## Summary

I used the Titanic data to show that survival rate for male was much lower then for 
women and children. As a basis I used the Titanic dataset I cleaned for my P2 project.

## Design 

In my first design I planned to use a stacked bar to who the difference between for 
all three groups (male, female, child) in survival rate. Bar charts are well suited to compare
categorical data. Based on feedback I got i changed this to a simple bar chart.
To better compare the three groups, I calculated the survival rate in percentages, instead of using
the actual number of people who survived and died. Using the actual numbers would have made it difficult
to compare the groups.
I am adding a title "The survival rate on board of the Titanic".

## Feedback

My plan to use a stacked bar chart was considered by my reviewers as unnecessary, since only two values
are stacked. A simple bar chart gives a much cleaner and more focused chart. 
At first I used grey to color the bars, a lot of people wanted some color, steelblue was best received.
At that point I also decided to emphasize the male group by using lightsteelblue for the other two bars.
Finally, the title was not enough for everybody to understand which message I was trying to present.
So I changed it and added a lead text.
