# Project Make Effective Data Visualisation

## Summary

I used the Titanic data to show that survival rate for male was much lower then for 
women and children. As a basis I used the Titanic dataset I cleaned for my P2 project.

## Design 

In my first design (see jpg file) I planned to use a stacked bar to who the difference between for 
all three groups (male, female, child) in survival rate. Bar charts are well suited to compare
categorical data. 
To better compare the three groups, I calculated the survival rate in percentages, instead of using
the actual number of people who survived and died. Using the actual numbers would have made it difficult
to compare the groups. 
I am adding a title "The survival rate on board of the Titanic".

## Feedback

The reviewers were my daughter (reviewer #1), my wife (reviewer #2) and a colleague (reviewer #3) and of
course the reviewer from Udacity.
My design to use a stacked bar chart was considered by my daughter (reviewer # 1) as unnecessary, since only two values
are stacked. A simple bar chart gives a much cleaner and more focused chart. 
At first I used grey to color the bars, all my reviewers wanted some color, steelblue was best received.
At that point I also decided to emphasize the male group by using lightsteelblue for the other two bars.
My daughter and wife preferred to display a survival rate, where originally I planned to display a death rate.
They felt it the low bar on males gave a much stronger message.
The title was not enough for my colleague to understand which message I was trying to present.
So I changed it and added a lead text. I also used red and green in the tooltip for easy recognition of the data
after feedback from my colleague.
